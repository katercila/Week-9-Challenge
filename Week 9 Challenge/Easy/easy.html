    <h3>
        A local gym wants to implement an "exercise of the day" program where there is a free class that day that promotes a certain exercise. The gym needs some backend logic that will update its system to reflect which exercise will be promoted that day. Write a function that will take as an input the name of an exercise and console log a message like Today's exercise: running
Note: you should only write one function that can dynamically print the value of   		the exercise for that day, and it must be a closure
